The Ka-Rov is a mythological creature thought to be the ultimate progenitor of the realm of Meria.  His appearance and form are uncertain, having been described in various conflicting ways throughout the legend's history.  However, there are commonalities among all tellings: the creature was born from the [Ooze](wiki/ooze.md) of the mythological [River Ka](wiki/river_ka.md).  It (in some tellings, "He") was a hideous beast, unfit for life, and struggling to survive from the instant he was created.  It lumbered away from the River and into the caverns, only to fall dead after violently coughing or vomiting up the [Stones of the Panchromacy](wiki/stones_of_the_panchromacy.md).  Its body then decayed, and the power of the stones imbued it with the capacity to give rise to new life.  Thus the corpse became the World of Meria.

The story of the Ka-Rov was relayed orally throughout Meria for many centuries; murals thought to depict it have been uncovered dating back to -6,000 I, milennia before the founding of the first Kingdoms.  The first written account comes from [Mer](wiki/mer) c. -140 I, from the early [Poet](wiki/Poets) [Rasa](wiki/Rasa), relayed here as follows:

## The Tragedy of the Ka-Rov

> O, The River Ka!

> Through writhing caverns, lazily it crawls

> There is no sound to echo through the depths

> Nor sun to cast a light upon the walls

> The River is the only source of light
> a faint and pallid glow by which to see
> at least for creatures blest with gift of sight

> Creatures, yes, the myriad ghouls who rise
> up from the Ooze, and drag themselves ashore
> Only to lumber forth to their demise

> And lay in dark repose forevermore

> O, The River Ka!

> Birthplace of that abominable wretch
> who from the Ooze did crawl some eon past,
> and stumbled forth with broken limbs outstretched

> That Ooze, that nectar from which life can spring
> Flowing uncontrolled and unrestrained
> Wreaks horror far beyond imagining

> Standing three men high and bloody-red
> A beak from its contorted skull protrudes
> Its stench is that of hundreds freshly dead

> The Ka-Rov claws itself out of the Ooze

> O, The River Ka!

> With branches that meander through the void
> The Ka-Rov takes its pick and presses on
> Longing through its pain to be destroyed

> The agony that creature felt, the pain
> Which plagued its futile venture from the depths
> Is known to none within this mortal plane

> The creature's journey ceased on that same shore
> And tired, blind and suff'ring, down he lay
> like all the rest, to stay forevermore

> The Ka-Rov found a place to make his grave

> O, The River Ka!

> Headstone of that poor and lonely thing
> which in its caverns petty solace sought
> And found no answer to its suffering

> It lay awaiting death, and as it groaned
> and coughed and sputtered Ooze upon the ground
> from its beak emerged a set of Stones

> The Ka-Rov learned that day the only thing
> that life teaches all creatures in due time:
> That all things end, including suffering

> The Ka-Rov lay in peace, and ceased its climb

> O, The River Ka!

> Which all things makes and all things then consumes,
> Destroyed the creature's corpse, which there decayed
> Amid the stones, thus setting life abloom

> Another lesson, learned by lucky few:
> That nothing is destroyed, only transformed
> Likewise the Ka-Rov transfigured, too

> For in its corpse was born life in new forms,
> to whom their sustenance its corpse would give,
> And men of ambition, to whom life

> has yet to teach the lesson
> that it teaches all who live.

The first testament to the Ka-Rov in prose form is dated to roughly the same time and was written anonymously.  It reads:

>The River of Ka cuts a writhing path through the Black Caverns. It flows slowly, like syrup; its waters are not waters at all, but a pale bluish-white goo. To the timeless hollows through which it flows, this substance has no name. To the Merians, it is called the Primordial Ooze.

>Along the River’s rocky banks, creatures born of the Ooze crawl, slither, and otherwise amble onto the jagged cavern floor. Most die soon after. Some live, by sheer dumb luck. Some reproduce. Some venture into the caverns’ branching corridors, their ways dimly lit by the River’s soft glow, and find passage into distant worlds, distant times. But this is not the fate of most creatures. Most of them die.

> The Ka-Rov, that massive, revolting beast, was fated to become such a creature when it first touched the black shores in some distant, unknown age. It heaved itself into existence from the viscous depths of that ancient River and onto the desolate, dry stone of the cavern floor. A layer of Ooze clung to its skin, giving it a faint bluish glow. Its vulture’s beak protruded from a hideous, eyeless head. The head, bulbous and drooping, sat atop a short neck, itself protruding from a torso which seemed only half-formed from clay. Its three arms, two thick with knotty, unshapely muscles and the other ghostly thin, seemed to burst forth from its body in random directions, as though trying to escape the ghastly creature to which they were bound. Its legs were those of a dog, and it supported half its weight on these and the other half on one of its stronger arms, which extended from its chest. The beast was red as blood and as tall as three men, and its stench was as if Death himself had died, and now decayed in the damp air and the heat of some scorching sun.

> The beast ventured forth like so many of the others. It lumbered along the rough cavern floor, hauling itself by its knobby knuckles which looked like knots in the bark of a tree, bleeding the bluish white of the River’s Ooze onto the stony ground. As it made its way, its beak spewed a near-constant stream of Oozy vomit, and between the streams, hoarse wails of pain. As it ventured further, its body weakened, depleting as the vomit continued to erupt from its body. On the verge of death, the creature stopped; its arms and legs buckled under its clumsy, lopsided form. The Ka-Rov curled up on the ground and prepared to coat the cavern floor in the Oozy bile until it finally, mercifully, perished. And so it did, for many hours, until, at last, the vomit caught in its throat. The creature coughed violently, one, two, three times, and on this third cough a stone flew from its horrid beak, landing in the midst of the puddle of Ooze the creature had splashed upon the cavern floor. The coughing fit continued, intensified, and the beast ejected another stone, and another, and finally a fourth. The eyeless beast could not see their colors.
The Primordial Ooze consumed the putrid corpse. In its place, a new world was born in those dark caverns. In that world were born creatures, and of those creatures were born men. And in those men was born a fatal lust.
