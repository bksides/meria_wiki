Maori was a kingdom of relatively little power and relevance prior to the Impirial Era.  As Mer advanced technologically
and required increased steel, it began to encroach on Maorian territory, forcing those who lived there to work in the
mountain mines.  The Sink, a rich source of iron, was taken as Merian Territory.  Maori, which had never bothered
technically claiming its borders, tolerated the encroachment until the forced labor began, after which it voluntarily ceded
the territory in exchange for assurance that no more Maori people would be forced to work, and the current slaves would
be released.  Mer agreed, sending large numbers of slaves back in chunks as it fortified its new borders with myriad
outposts.  Once the border was safely secured, Mer stopped releasing slaves and turned a blind eye to occasional
raids in which Maorians were captured and enslaved.

In the Great Old War, Mer offered Maori control of the Sink in exchange for fealty and military assistance.  This, along
with the history of conflict between Maori and Ariwa over Yerevan, motivated them to accept the offer.  After their
victory, however, Mer remained in control of the Sink AND had conquered Yerevan.  Maori received only protection as a
vassal of Meria, and preferential treatment in trade, especially the same steel that Mer was mining from their own
mountains.

It was not until the Empire's fall that Maoriand would cease to be enslaved by Mer.  Many Maorians are distrustful of
Merians due to the relations between the two countries.  Mer still controls the Maorian mountsins as well as Yerevan.
