The Coven is a term for the territories of the nations of Yari and Mari.  Before the Merian Empire, the terrirories were
ruled by three Sister-Matriarchs.  They were three sovereign monarchies, but largely functioned as a single polity
under the collective rule of the three sisters.

After the Great Old War began, the sisters joined the Ariwan forces to repel the expansion of Mer; Mer had subjected
the Kingdoms to increasingly draconian trade treaties, including an Ooze export quota.  As Mer gained the upper hand,
the Sisters' alliance with Ariwa became relatively unpopular.  Shortly before the turn of the war, Yari betrayed her
sisters by murdering the childless Hari, usurping her kingdom, and declaring her allegience to Mer.  Hari's soldiers
were divided, many defecting to Yari's forces, but most remaining loyal to Yari, having been frustrated with being
sent to die by Hari.

After the war, Yari was given control of the entire coven by Imperium.  Mari, forced to abdicate, fled
and lived in exile in Miraan, where she and her descendents lived until the Empire's fall.  Yari now unilaterally
controlled the substantial Ooze supply in the Coven and largely refused to export it to formerly Ariwan-aligned
territories - particularly Miraan, which harbored her sister - except where forced to do so by the Empire.

Following the Empire's fall, Yari completely ceased Ooze exports to Ariwan-aligned territories, and severely limited
exports to all other countries.  The Ariwan-aligned territories lobby Mari to return to the Coven and reclaim her former
territory.  The Ariwan nations agree to use their militaries to help install Mari as Queen, and Mari launches her
offensive.

Yari's people and military, suffering due to the limited imports coming into Yari, largely refuse to fight.  Mari is
reinstalled quickly and with minimal bloodshed, and agrees to generously export its Ooze supplies as part of its trade
treaties.  Yari opens up her trade as well, having been put in a much weaker position.  The border between the two
kingdoms has been militarizing ever since, but the border is so dominated by wilderness that travel between them
is still common and relatively easy.

Yari is the only ruler who still swears fealty to Meria and to Proditor, the last emporer.
